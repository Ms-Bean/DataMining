## Assignments completed

## Project milestones completed
- Milestone 1, downloading a library of youtube videos and uploading to Google Drive, located in Project/
    - The client_secrets.json file for authenticating with Google Drive has been added to .gitignore so that somebody can basically not steal it and abuse my rate limits. In order for this project to work on your end, you will have to replace it with your own client secrets.
    
    - If this were not a graded assignment, I would also never have uploaded the large video files to this repository as it is poor practice to do so. I am uploading them so that you can see that the videos were successfully downloaded, but I just want you to know that I did not enjoy doing so.

    - In addition, there is also an image of the files successfully uploaded to Google Drive in Project/gdrive.png
